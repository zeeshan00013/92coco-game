            <strong>1.</strong> The referral program includes up to 6 levels.
            For example, if you invite a friend (A), they become your level 1.
            If A invites someone else (B), that person becomes your level 2, and
            so on up to level 6.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>2.</strong> To build your team, make sure your friends
            register using your referral link or enter your invite code manually
            during sign-up.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3.</strong> Once your referral signs up using your link and
            makes a deposit, your reward will be credited right away.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>4.</strong> Daily earnings from your referrals are
            calculated every day at 01:00. Once the process is done, your bonus
            is added to your wallet and recorded in your commission log.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>5.</strong> Your bonus rate depends on your rank. It's based
            on how many team members you have and how much they deposit in a
            single day.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>6.</strong> The higher your membership tier, the better your
            reward rate. Each game type also comes with its own payout
            percentage. You can check detailed reward info under "Rebate Ratio."
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>7.</strong> The top 20 referrers are randomly rewarded with
            extra prizes as a bonus for their performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>8.</strong> All rights to explain and manage this program
            are reserved by 92COCO.
